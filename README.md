### Gamer, Reader, Programmer, Developer

### Why Hello There!
I'm Jupiter Dev, and I've been programming since I was 8!
Languages:
- Python always
- HTML/CSS if I need to
- Java if I am making a Minecraft Mod
- Golang for fun
- Javascript sort of
- C# if I had a gun against my head
- Scratch if I'm bored
- French I can read & write about 3 words:
  - Je suis fatigue!
- ASL but not really

# 👋 Hi, I'm JupiterDev
### A nerd who was given a keyboard, so he learned to code.

I'm a developer building silly little tools, usually because nobody else has.  
I love working with Python and Qt and building Desktop apps - but I'm also making a secret thing 👀.

## Cool Projects

### mDirt
mDirt is my magnum opus. Is it depressing that something so useless is my most important & largest project? Maybe.
mDirt is a datapack creator, letting the user use a simple UI to create datapacks- no code required!

### KoreUI
KoreUI is a dynamic UI builder. It inputs a standard JSON Schema and returns with a PySide6 widget.
Created over the span of 1 week (Yes, it took me 7 days. No, I don't want to tallk about it), it is a bit of a mess, but it works.
###### Sometimes.
